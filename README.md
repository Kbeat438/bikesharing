#Results: The first graph shows that the south side of Manhattan, the most populated side, has the most trip starts. The second graph shows that most bike trips are only 10 minutes in duration. The third graph shows that males checkout bikes 3 times more than woman. The fourth graph shows that 5 and 6pm are the most common bike checkout times in August. The fifth graph shows that during the work week there are more people taking bike rides. The 6th graph shows that mostly males are riding bikes throughout the week. The last graph shows that most people who are using the bike shaing service are subscribers.     


#Summary: These graphs show that a large male population that usually travels 10 minutes to and from work would benefit from a bike sharing service. All of this data points to that conclusion. two other graphs that could be made from this data that would help support or counter this theory are a graph that shows the time in hours that customers ended at a station and a graph that shows the age group of the people using the bikesharing service the most.
